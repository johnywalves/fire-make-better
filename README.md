Project developed for study in [Angular](https://angular.io/), to organize some recipes, currently researching in [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

And run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4200/fire-make-better/](http://localhost:4200/fire-make-better/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying src/app/app.component.html. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
